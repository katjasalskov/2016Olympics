								<center>
									<p>All of our analysis is based on datasets downloaded from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rio2016/olympic-games" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> 
										and texts scraped from Wikipedia pages of Countries, Sports, and Athelets from the Olympic 2016.										
										Below is presented an exciting example of what a Wikipedia page of a random athlete participating at the Olympic 2016 looks like.</p>

									<p>   	<br/>
										We want to create an Olympic Network of the Countries, Sports, and Athletes to see how they connect. 
										So therefore all the Wikipedia pages of Countries, Sports, and Athletes (if the athlete has a Wikipedia page) were downloaded.
										These Wikipedia pages will act as nodes in the network and the links between the Wikipedia pages will act like links in the network.
										A visualization of the network can be seen below.</p>

									<h2>Get an understanding of the Olympic Network<br /></h2>
									<p>We want to dive deeper into the network and calculate some basic statistics.</b>. </p>

					<!-- BASIC STATS -->
								<center>
									<p> It is important to get to know the network by its basic statistics and structure. This will give you a nice feeling, 
										that you will know which type of network you are working with and how nodes are connected in the network. The Olympic Network is 
										a directed network, which means that node A can link to node B, but node B does not necessarily link to node A. <br/>
										<br/>
										The Olympic Network has <b>5.463 nodes</b> and <b>16.306 links</b>
										<br/>
										<br/>
										We want to investigate the properties of the nodes. Let's start by finding links in and out of each node, this is also called the degree. 
										The average degree of the total Olympic network is <b>5,97</b>. The average is sensitive to large in and/or out degrees. Therefore it is interesting to study the median 
										for the in- and out-degrees. The median is stable to nodes with extreme degrees. The median for in-degree is <b>2</b>, which tells us that most nodes have very few in-degrees. 
										For out-degree, the median is <b>0</b>, which means that most of the nodes are not linking to other nodes. <br/>
										<br/>
										Okay, so the network has many nodes with a low degree and very few with a high degree. Which corresponds to a power law and that the network has a <i>hub-structure</i>. 
										A set of nodes where almost every node or at least many of the nodes link to is called a hub. This network structure is the main property in many real-world networks and it
										is also called <i>a Scale-free Network.</i> By having this network structure knowledge, further analysis will be more interesting and hopefully more successful.
