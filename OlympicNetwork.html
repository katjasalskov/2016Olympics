								<p>
								The Olympic Games 2016's countries, sports and athletes are connected across the board. 
									This can be seen by all the orange links between the red, green, and blue nodes on the above network. 
								
								The size of each node is explaining how many links each node has, and the colors
								tell whether the node is a country, a sport, or an athlete at the Olympics in Rio 2016.
								<br />
								By looking at the network, we can see that the countries, in general, have the most links. 
									This make sense, due to the fact that each countrys' Wikipedia page link to all the 
									athletes representing their nation. Furthermore each sport are also listing all the athletes
									in that speecific sport competing at the Olympics in Rio. <br /> 
									
									The Olympic graph inlightens a clear national tendency, where big red nodes all link to the green athlete nodes of their country.
									 
									Furthermore, there are some groups of nodes, that are more connected than others. As an
									example, the green, very big and dense looking 
									clusters in the right bottom side of the network. Both clusters look like they are linking to the same 
									sport (the blue node to the right of them).  <br />

									<h2>Community detection<br /></h2>
								</header>
									<p>In network science, a group of nodes that have a higher likelyhood of connecting
									to each other than to other groups of nodes are called a community. Interested in the theory behind? Take a look at
										<a href="http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/9">[Network Science book, Chapter 9]</a>.<br />
									Just by looking at the above Olympic Network, we can see that some of the nodes probably have a higher chance of linking to each other than to other nodes.
										Let's investigate the Olympics community structure:</p>

								  <div class='fill-screen'>
 								    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/OLcom.jpg" alt="" /></span>								    
								  </div>
									
								</center>


								
								<p> The above graph shows the Olympic network now, where a community algorithm is run on the data.
									Now each node belongs to a community which is visualized by the specific community colors. 
									The Network is still super complex, but some tendency becomes visible. As discovered earlier, the two very dense clusters 
									do have more likelihood of connecting inside the cluster than to anyone else, which is why they have become the respectively community 
									17 and 21. Furthermore, the graph shows that the athletes from the same country are most likely to be in a community together. 
									
									
									It is still difficult to interpret much from this visualization. Let's continue the investigation by detecting the size of the communities:

									<h3>Community sizes<br /></h3>
								</header>
								<p>The number of athletes, countries and sports (nodes) are counted for each of the <b>28 communities </b> and plottet below.
								The x-axis corresponds to the communities where the y-axis shows the community size. Be aware that the x-axis does not correspond to the real community number, since the plot is sorted
								showing the largest community as community 0.</p>

								  <div class='fill-screen'>
 								    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/comsizedist.jpg" alt="" /></span>								    
								  </div>
									
								</center>


								
								<p>Looking at the plot, the size of each community is very different.
								Looking at the size of the largest community, it contains more than 500 nodes. Comparing this to the smallest community, the size is below 20. 
								How come the sizes of each community be so different you might ask. <br />
								Let's try and find out by investigating what each node's Wikipedia page is all about!

									<h2>What is each community about?<br /></h2>
								</header>
								<p>Besides looking at the nodes' connections to each other and the size of them, how can you obtain more knowledge about the nodes?
									What about visiting every single nodes' Wikipedia page, to read and understand more about them and maybe even understand why they are in the specific community? 
									This have already been done for you, and all the words for each community have been collected. 
									Then, an algorithm, called TF-IDF (<i>Term frequency–Inverse document frequency</i>) has been used to find the important words in each community. You can read more about this
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf">[here]</a>.<br />
									The most important words from the first eight communities are plotted in the following word clouds. 
								Try and see if you can explain anything about the different communities, by looking at these word clouds.
									</p>

								<p>Cool right? <br />
								What have you discovered? <br />
									<p>To be honest, the themes of the communities did not become very clear from these word clouds. The algorithm did not work as well as
									wished. Try visit 
										<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics">[Brazils Wikipedia page]</a>. How many times are the word <font size="+1"> <i>birth</i> </font> counted?
										Yes. 11 times. Now try visit 
										<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martine_Grael">[Martine Graels Wikipedia page]</a>. 
										How many times are the word *birth* counted on her page?
										Correct. 0 times. This is the case for athletes versus countries Wikipedia pages. 
										Because of the TF-IDF calculations, the word <i>birth</i> gets a lot of saying in each community where countries are a part of the community. 
										
										It turns out, that it is difficult to identify the important words when you mix the type of content in the Wikipedia pages (e.g both reading countries, sports, and athletes Wikipedia pages).
										This is especially difficult when there are not equally many nodes of each three categories. 
										 
									However, we get the feeling, that the communities are based upon the athletes' nationality and or the sport that they have in common.
										As an example, we can see that community 0 is probably having the <i>Philippine</i> in common, and community 8 might have <i>golf</i> in common.
										<br />
										What
									Let's investigate the athletes' network as a sub-network to the big Olympic Network. This might reveal more information when looking at the Wikipedia pages.
