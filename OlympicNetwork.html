								<p>
								The Olympic Games 2016's countries, sports and athletes are connected across the board. 
									This can be seen by all the orange links between the red, green and blue nodes on the above netowrk. 
								
								The size of each node is explaining how many links each node has, and the colors
								tell whether the node is a country, a sport or an athlete at the Olympcs in Rio 2016.
								<br />
								By looking at the network, we can see that the countries in general have the most links. 
									This make sense, due to the fact that each countrys' Wikipedia page link to all the 
									athletes representing their nation. Furthermore each sport are also listing all the athletes
									in that speecific sport competing at he Olympics in Rio. <br /> 
									
									The Olympic graph inlighten a clear national tendency, where big red nodes all link to the green athlete nodes of their country.
									 
									Furthermore, there are some groups of nodes, that are more connected than others. As an
									example, the green, very big and dense looking 
									clusters in the right bottom side of the network. Both clusters look like they are linking to the same 
									sport (the blue node to the right of them). <br /> 
									Lets see if this is true.

									<h2>Community detection<br /></h2>
								</header>
									<p>In network science, a group of nodes that have a higher likelyhood of connecting<br />
									to each other than to other groups of nodes are called a community.
										<a href="http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/9">[Network Science book, Chapter 9]</a>.</p><br />
									Let's investigate the Olympics community structure:</p>
						
					<!-- COMMUNITY DETECTION  -->

 								    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/atletnetwork.jpg" alt="" /></span>								    
								  </div>
									
								</center>


								
								<p> The above network show the Olympic network, now where a community algorithm is run on the data, 
									and each node is given a specific community. These communities have their own color, that show how each node belongs to a community. 
									The Network is still super complex, but some tendency becomes visible. Two communities are especially visible since they are super dense.
									FORKLAR MERE TIL DENNE 	
									
									Is is still difficult to interpret much from this visulasation. Lets continue to detect the sizes of the communities:

									<h3>Community sizes<br /></h3>
								</header>
								<p>The number of athletes, countries and sports (nodes) are counted for each of the <b>28 communities </b> and plottet below.
								The x-axis show the community number where the y-axis show the community size.</p>

 								    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/comsizedist.jpg" alt="" /></span>								    
								  </div>
									
								</center>


								
								<p>Looking at the plot, it is shown that the community sizes are very different.
								Looking at the size of community 0, it is almost 700 nodes. Comparing this to community 25, the size is below 10. 
								How come these sizes be so different you might ask.
								<b>Well, looking back at the example with the tennis players, we can see that they belong to community <b>XXXXX</b>. This 
								community is not very big, but it is very dense. This shows us, that the more links the nodes have between each other, 
								the more dense and close the community are, but the fewer nodes are included in the community. Looking at the bigger sized 
								communities, as community 0, much more different athletes, countries, and events are in the community, but they are more spread out 
								without nearly as many links between each other.</b> </p>

<!-- 					WORD CLOUDS	 -->

								<header class="major">
									<h2>What is each community about?<br /></h2>
								</header>
								<p>We would like to get to know each community better. However, besides looking at their connections with each other and the size of them, what can we do?
									We have visited every single nodes' Wikipedia page, to read and understand more about the communities. 
									Then, an algorithm, called TF-IDF (<i>Term frequency–Inverse document frequency</i>) is used to find the important words in each community. You can read more about this
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf">[here]</a>.</p><br />.
									The main important words from each community are plotted in the following word clouds. Try and see if you can explain anything about the different communities, by looking at these word clouds.
									</p>

								  </div>
									
								</center>

								<p>Cool right? <br />
								What have you discovered? <br />
									<p>To be honest, the themes of the communities did not become very clear from these word clouds. The algorithm did not work as well as we
									wished. It turns out, that it is difficult to identify the important words when you mix the type of content in the Wikipedia pages. 
									However, we get the feeling, that the communities are based upon the athletes' nationality and or the sport that they have in common. <br />
										As an example, we can see that community <b> XXXX is filled with words about swimming. </b>
									OK. Maybe we should try and investigate the athletes' network as a sub-network to the big Olympic Network? This might reveal more information when looking at the Wikipedia pages.
